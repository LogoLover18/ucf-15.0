    <p>The best way to get familiar with the Unicode Character Finder is to
    play with it - type in the boxes, push the buttons and see where they lead
    you.  The paragraphs below describe the available features.</p>

    <h1>Inspect Character Properties</h1>

    <p>The <b>character preview</b> area is intially blank. You can <b>(1)</b>
    click in the left-hand box; <b>(2)</b> type a character or copy &amp; paste
    from another window; and <b>(3)</b> view the character properties on the
    right.</p>

    <p><img src="images/char-props.png" alt="picture of character properties" /></p>

    <p>The <b>Code point</b> number (eg: U+00E7) uniquely identifies the
    character in the Unicode code charts.</p>

    <p>The character <b>Description</b> comes from the Unicode character
    database.  If the character has an alias (alternate description) this
    will be displayed also.</p>

    <p>The <b>HTML entity</b> is one form you can use to represent the
    character in the source of an HTML page.  Of course if you've set up your
    page encoding properly then you could just paste the character in.</p>

    <p>The <b>Character block</b> is the descriptive name for the group of
    characters that this one belongs to.  The name is a <i>clickable link</i>
    to the PDF file on the Unicode web site that illustrates and describes all
    the characters in the block.</p>

    <h1>Search for a Character</h1>

    <p>You can search the character descriptions by simply typing some text
    in the search box.  After a short delay, the first 10 matches will be
    displayed.</p>

    <p><img src="images/char-search.png" alt="picture of character search" /></p>

    <p>Unfortunately this is not an exhaustive search since the data file does
    not include a description for every character.  The software also does not
    currently provide access to more than 10 search results - this will be
    addressed in a later release (you may be able to work around this
    limitation by refining your search).</p>

    <p>In addition to the straight text match, you can also do a <b>regular
    expression</b> search of the character descriptions.  If your search query
    begins and ends with the forward slash character ('/'), then the search
    will use regular expression rules.</p>

    <h1>Browse the Code Charts</h1>

    <p>When a character is displayed in the <b>character preview</b> area,
    three buttons are available beneath it:</p>

    <p><img src="images/char-browse.png" alt="picture of browse buttons" /></p>

    <p>The left button (◀) will display the character that precedes the
    current selection in the character chart.  For example if the character
    'Y' is displayed, pressing this button will display 'X'.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the right button (▶) will display the character that follows
    the current selection.</p>

    <p>The middle button (▼) will display the section of the character chart
    which includes the currently selected character.</p>

    <p><img src="images/char-chart.png" alt="picture of character chart" /></p>

    <p>You can click on characters in this code chart to examine their
    properties.</p>

    <p>The <b>Next</b> and <b>Prev</b> buttons display the the next and
    previous pages of the code chart respectively.</p>
